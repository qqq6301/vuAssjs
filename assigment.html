    <li>In CMD we used nslookup <a href="http://www.few.vu.nl">
    http://www.few.vu.nl</a> and the respond was:
    Server: ns.vu.nl<br />
    Address: 130.37.129.4<br />
    Name: soling-public.few.vu.nl<br />
    Address 130.37.20.20<br />
    Aliases: www.few.vu.nl<br />
    The same for <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl">http://www.cs.vu.nl</a><br />
    Server: ns.vu.nl<br />
    Address: 130.37.129.4<br />
    Name: soling-public.few.vu.nl<br />
    Address 130.37.20.20<br />
    Aliases: <a href="www.cs.vu.nl">www.cs.vu.nl</a><br />
    Soling-public.cs.vu.nl<br />
    They have the same server.</li><br />
    
    <li><a href="www.example.com">www.example.com</a> and 
    <a href="www.example.org">www.example.org</a> have the same owner. 
    Nslookup gives the same ip-adresses for both. They are reserved for people to 
    link to as illustrative examples in documents. The domains are owned by domain 
    providers.</li><br />
    
    <li>Because the shortage of IP-adresses IPv6 has been introduced. 
    This uses more bits and can provide more IP-adresses.</li><br />
    
    <li>SIDN (the Foundation for Internet Domain Registration in the Netherlands) 
    has the role to maintain a reliable, open and secure internet and provide 
    domain names for those who want them.</li><br />
    
    <li>Weblanguages and protocols such as HTML, XML, CSS and HTTP</li><br />
    
    <li> &ltstrong&gt has meaning and &ltb&gt is just the styling. <br />
    &lt em> has meaning and &lt i> is just the styling.</li><br />
    
    <li>The difference is that span is used in between text lines and div is 
    used outside of them.</li><br />
    
    <li>Pro: It keeps a part of the page static, requiring less bandwidth. <br />
    Con: Frames break easily if the site is not used the way it is meant to, 
    like using a cached version of the page.</li><br />
    
    <li>CSS style sheets compliment well with HTML, and make it easier for developers 
    to change the page layout and position elements anywhere on the page, while the 
    website remains consistent.  It is possible to use more than one style sheet at 
    the same time, enabling the developer to apply different elements to a web page. 
    Furthermore, pages load more easily, because the CSS content gets cached. 
    Search engines have a preference to feature websites using CSS style sheets.  
    Also, it is simple to create a print friendly web page for an HTML based web 
    application. All browsers are compatible with CSS.</li><br />
